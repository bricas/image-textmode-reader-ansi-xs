=head1 NAME

Image::TextMode::Reader::ANSI::XS - Fast ANSI image parsing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # The XS reader will automatically be used instead of the pure-perl version
    my $ansi = Image::TextMode::Format::ANSI->new
    $ansi->read( shift );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To parse an ANSI file, we use a simple state machine and examine each character
individually. This proves to be a little on the slow side in pure-perl form.

This module endeavors to re-implement the parsing in XS/C. The results show
a major speed increase; about 25 times faster.

=head1 INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

=head1 METHODS

=head2 _read( $image, $fh, \%options )

This is an XS-based version of L<Image::TextMode::Reader::ANSI>'s method of the
same name.
